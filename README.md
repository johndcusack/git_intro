This piece of work is intended to produce an intro to git and github for NHS E South East Region colleagues who have not worked with either at all. 

My goal is for it to form the basis for an document that will help people get a basic understanding of how to use git and github in general.
Additionally I want to establish a core way of working for the team I am part of so that we have a consistent approach to how we are using these tools.

I'm setting it up in quarto partly to allow for easier collaboration, and partly because it will give me a chance to work more in quarto and transition away from RMarkdown.
