## What is Git?

Git is a version control system.

### That's it? So, what's all of the fuss about?

Yep that's it. Git is just a way to keep track of a project or even a single document as it is being worked on.

The reason we want to use it is that it is something that makes working collaboratively on a piece of work much easier because everyone can work on their own copy of a thing and git will keep track of them  and has been around for nearly 20 years at the time of writing this document. It is lightweight, fast and open source.
